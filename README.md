# Diabetes and Insulin Management Prediction using Logistic Regression

This machine learning project uses patient data to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not. Furthermore, for positive cases that require the use of a CGM device and an insulin pump, patterns in the patient's blood glucose levels and data from the insulin pump are used to predict how the patient will respond to different levels of insulin dosage. This model has the potential to optimize the patient's insulin regimen and reduce the risk of complications from diabetes.
