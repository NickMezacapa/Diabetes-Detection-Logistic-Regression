# Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Logistic Regression

This machine learning project aims to predict whether an individual is likely to develop type 2 diabetes or not within the next 5 years. The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which is available on Kaggle and originally made public by the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/).

To improve the understanding of underlying risk factors leading to diabetes, a logistic regression model and decision tree is utilized to predict the onset of type 2 diabetes for Pima Indian women. A six-fold classification tree is explored to complement and validate the analysis.<br>

## Introduction

[Diabetes mellitus](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/diabetes.html) is one of the most common human diseases worldwide. It is a chronic health condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). The body needs insulin to convert glucose into energy, and in individuals with diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces. This causes glucose to build up in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications. It is responsible for considerable morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Among diabetes patients, type 2 diabetes accounts for ~90-95% of cases. <br>

The main risk factos for type 2 diabetes include (but are not limited to) obesity, body mass index, physical inactivity, family history, age, ethnicity, and history of gestational diabetes.<br>

A timely diagnosis of diabetes is needed for patients to take appropriate measures to prevent the onset of complications. Prediction models can be used to screen individuals with an increased risk of developing diabetes to help decide the best clinical management for patients. The prediction performance and validity of these models can vary significantly depending on the input variables that are used. <br>
